        <h3>The Dance of Molecules</h3>

        <p>
            Matter doesn't just exist in one form—it's constantly shifting between
            different states based on how much energy its particles have and how
            strongly they attract each other.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Solids: The Disciplined Dancers</strong></p>
            <p>In solids, molecules are locked in rigid formations like dancers frozen in formation. They vibrate in place but can't move freely. This gives solids their definite shape and volume, but also makes them incompressible.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Liquids: The Fluid Performers</strong></p>
            <p>Add energy (usually heat), and the molecular dance becomes more energetic. Molecules can now slide past each other while staying close together. Liquids take the shape of their container but maintain their volume—they're the conformists of the matter world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Gases: The Free Spirits</strong></p>
            <p>Give molecules even more energy, and they break free entirely. Gas molecules zoom around at incredible speeds, colliding with each other and their container walls. They expand to fill any space available and can be compressed into smaller volumes.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Phase Changes: The Molecular Transformation</strong><br />The
            transitions between states tell dramatic stories. When ice melts, it's
            absorbing enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds holding water
            molecules in their crystalline prison. When water boils, molecules are
            gaining enough energy to escape the liquid entirely and become vapor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some substances can even skip the liquid phase entirely—sublimation allows
            solids to become gases directly, like dry ice transforming into carbon
            dioxide vapor.
