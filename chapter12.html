        <h3>The Great Chemical Tug-of-War</h3>

        <p>
            In chemistry, there's an ongoing battle between two types of substances:
            acids and bases. This isn't just abstract chemistry—this battle is
            happening in your mouth, your stomach, your blood, and throughout your
            body every second of your life.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Acids: The Proton Donors</strong></p>
            <p>Acids are the aggressive molecules that want to give away hydrogen ions (protons). They turn blue litmus paper red, taste sour (though you should never taste unknown chemicals!), and can dissolve metals. The hydrochloric acid in your stomach is strong enough to dissolve metal, yet your stomach lining handles it every day.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Bases: The Proton Recipients</strong></p>
            <p>Bases are the molecules that accept those protons that acids want to give away. They turn red litmus paper blue, feel slippery, taste bitter, and can neutralize acids. The ammonia in household cleaners, the sodium bicarbonate in baking soda, and the calcium hydroxide in antacids are all bases doing their job.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>The pH Scale: Measuring the Battle</strong><br />The pH scale from
            0 to 14 measures who's winning the acid-base battle. Below 7 is acidic
            territory (acids are winning), above 7 is basic territory (bases
            dominate), and 7 is neutral (perfect balance). Your blood must stay
            between 7.35 and 7.45—even small deviations can be life-threatening, which
            is why your body has elaborate buffering systems to maintain this balance.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Chemistry of Life</strong><br />Acid-base chemistry isn't just
            laboratory curiosity—it's fundamental to life: - Your stomach uses acid to
            digest food - Your body carefully buffers your blood pH - Plants and
            animals can only survive within specific pH ranges - Even the formation of
            caves (acid rain dissolving limestone) demonstrates acid-base chemistry
            shaping our world
