        <h3>When Substances Disappear Into Each Other</h3>

        <p>
            Solutions are chemistry's magic tricks—one substance completely disappears
            into another, creating something that looks uniform but contains both
            components. When you dissolve sugar in coffee, the sugar doesn't
            vanish—its molecules disperse so evenly throughout the water that you
            can't see them anymore.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>The Golden Rule: "Like Dissolves Like"</strong></p>
            <p>"Like dissolves like" is chemistry's golden rule for predicting solubility. Polar substances (those with uneven charge distribution) love to dissolve in polar solvents like water. Nonpolar substances prefer nonpolar solvents. This is why oil and water don't mix—they're too different in polarity to form a solution.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Factors That Control Dissolution</strong><br />
            - <strong>Temperature</strong>: Generally, heating increases solubility
            for solids but decreases it for gases (think of how soda goes flat faster
            when warm)<br />
            - <strong>Pressure</strong>: Affects gas solubility dramatically
            (carbonated beverages use this principle)<br />
            - <strong>Surface area</strong>: Powdered sugar dissolves faster than
            sugar cubes because more surface is exposed to the solvent
        </p>

        <p>
            Solutions are everywhere: the air you breathe (gases dissolved in gases),
            the ocean (salts dissolved in water), your blood (countless substances
            dissolved in plasma), and even some metals (alloys are solid solutions).
