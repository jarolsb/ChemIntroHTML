        <h3>The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for the Universe</h3>

        <p>
            If the periodic table were a movie, it would be the greatest mystery
            thriller ever made. In the 1860s, Dmitri Mendeleev looked at the
            60-something known elements and saw something no one else could see—a
            pattern. He arranged the elements by weight and discovered that their
            properties repeated in predictable cycles.

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Mendeleev's Bold Prediction:</strong> Mendeleev was so confident in his pattern that when elements didn't fit, he assumed they were missing, not that his pattern was wrong. He left gaps in his table and predicted the exact properties of elements that hadn't been discovered yet. When those elements were finally found, they matched his predictions almost perfectly.</p>

            <p><strong>Reading the Table's Secrets</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Groups (columns) are like families</strong>: Elements in the same column have similar personalities because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell.</li>
                <li><strong>Periods (rows) tell a story</strong>: As you move across a row, you're adding one proton and one electron at a time, gradually changing the element's character.</li>
                <li><strong>The great divide</strong>: Metals on the left love to give away electrons, nonmetals on the right want to collect them, and metalloids in between can go either way.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The periodic table isn't just a chart—it's a map of chemical behavior that allows chemists to predict how any element will react before they've ever worked with it.</p>
