        <h3>Your Portal to the Molecular World</h3>

        <p>
            The chemistry laboratory is where abstract concepts become tangible
            reality. It's where you'll see the colors of chemical reactions, feel the
            heat of exothermic processes, and witness the dramatic transformations
            that define chemistry.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Safety: Your Most Important Tool</strong></p>
            <p>Before you can explore chemistry's wonders, you must respect its power. Chemical safety isn't about fear—it's about respect. Every chemical you'll work with has the potential to teach you something amazing, but only if you handle it properly.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
            <p><strong>Essential Safety Rules</strong></p>
            <p>The safety rules aren't arbitrary restrictions—they're lessons learned from centuries of chemists who discovered what works and what doesn't. Wear goggles because chemicals can splash unpredictably. Tie back long hair because Bunsen burners are unforgiving. Work in ventilated areas because many reactions produce vapors you shouldn't breathe.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Precision: The Language of Chemistry</strong><br />In the lab,
            precision isn't perfectionism—it's communication. When you measure exactly
            25.0 mL of solution instead of "about 25," you're speaking chemistry's
            language. When you record the exact temperature at which a substance
            melts, you're contributing to humanity's understanding of that substance.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Documentation: Telling Chemistry's Stories</strong><br />Every
            experiment you conduct adds to the grand story of chemical knowledge. Your
            lab reports aren't just assignments—they're communications to future
            scientists (including your future self) about what you discovered and how
            you discovered it.
        </p>

        <p>A well-written lab report includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The Quest</strong> (objective): What were you trying to
                discover?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Tools and Methods</strong>: How did you approach the
                problem?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Evidence</strong> (data and observations): What did you see
                and measure?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Conclusion</strong>: What does the evidence tell you about
                how chemistry works?
            </li>
        </ul>
