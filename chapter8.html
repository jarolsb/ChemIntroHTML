        <h3>When Matter Transforms</h3>

        <p>
            Chemical reactions are the universe's way of rearranging itself. Every
            reaction tells a story of bonds breaking and forming, of energy being
            absorbed and released, of matter transforming from one identity to
            another.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Synthesis: The Builders</strong></p>
            <p>In synthesis reactions, simple substances combine to create something more complex. It's like watching Lego blocks assemble themselves into a castle. When hydrogen and oxygen gases meet under the right conditions, they unite to form water—a substance with properties completely different from either parent gas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Decomposition: The Breakers</strong></p>
            <p>Decomposition reactions work in reverse, breaking complex substances into simpler parts. This is how plants break down water to release oxygen during photosynthesis, or how your body breaks down glucose to release energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Single Displacement: The Chemical Bully</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes a more reactive element muscles its way into a compound, kicking out a less reactive element. Drop a piece of zinc into a copper sulfate solution, and the zinc literally steals the sulfate from the copper, leaving behind beautiful copper metal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Double Displacement: The Partner Swap</strong></p>
            <p>In these reactions, compounds trade partners like dancers switching partners in an elaborate dance. When silver nitrate meets sodium chloride, the silver grabs the chloride and the sodium pairs with the nitrate, often creating a dramatic precipitate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Combustion: The Energy Liberators</strong></p>
            <p>Combustion reactions are chemistry's way of releasing stored energy. When gasoline burns in your car's engine, or when your body "burns" glucose for energy, complex molecules are breaking apart and combining with oxygen, releasing the energy that was stored in their bonds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Acid-Base: The Neutralizers</strong></p>
            <p>When acids and bases meet, they neutralize each other in reactions that often produce heat, water, and salts. These reactions keep your blood at the right pH and help your stomach digest food.</p>
