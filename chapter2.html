            <h2>The Power of Asking "Why?"</h2>
            
            <p>
                Every great chemist starts the same way: by asking questions. Why does
                iron rust? Why does bread rise? Why do some things dissolve while others
                don't? The scientific method isn't just a set of steps—it's a way of
                thinking that has revolutionized human understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Picture yourself as a detective solving the ultimate mystery: how does the
                world work? Like any good detective, you need a reliable process:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The scientific method is your toolkit for understanding the universe. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation for discovery.</p>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Observe the Scene</strong><br />Something catches your
                attention—maybe you notice that a penny left outside turns green, or
                that oil and water refuse to mix no matter how hard you stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gather Intelligence</strong><br />You investigate what
                others have discovered. Has someone else noticed this phenomenon? What
                did they learn?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Form a Theory</strong><br />Based on your observations
                and research, you propose an explanation—your hypothesis. This is your
                "suspect" in the mystery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Test Your Theory</strong><br />You design an experiment
                to put your hypothesis on trial. Can you prove or disprove your
                explanation?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analyze the Evidence</strong><br />The data from your
                experiment tells a story. Sometimes it confirms your theory, sometimes
                it reveals you were completely wrong—and both outcomes are valuable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Draw Conclusions</strong><br />What does the evidence
                tell you about how the world works?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Share Your Discovery</strong><br />Science is a team
                sport. Your findings become part of humanity's growing understanding of
                the universe.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This process repeats endlessly because each answer reveals new questions,
            and each discovery opens doors to rooms we never knew existed.

        <h2>Separating Truth from Fiction: The CRAAP Detective's Toolkit</h2>

        <p>
            In our information-rich world, not every source deserves your trust. Like
            a detective evaluating witness testimony, you need to assess the
            reliability of your information using the CRAAP test:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Currency</strong>: Is this information fresh enough to be
                relevant?

            <li>
                <strong>Relevance</strong>: Does it actually address your question?

            <li>
                <strong>Authority</strong>: Who's telling you this, and why should you
                believe them?
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Can you verify these claims?</li>
            <li>
