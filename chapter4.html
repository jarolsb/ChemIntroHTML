        <h1>Chapter 4: The Great Classification Adventure</h1>

        <p>
            Imagine if every book in the world was thrown into one enormous pile.
            Chaos, right? That's what the material world would look like without
            classification. Fortunately, matter organizes itself into beautiful,
            logical categories.
        </p>

        <h3>The Pure and the Mixed</h3>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Elements: The Fundamental Building Blocks</strong></p>
            <p>At the heart of everything are the elements—the alphabet of matter. Just as every word in every language can be built from a limited set of letters, everything in the universe is built from just 118 elements. Oxygen fills your lungs, iron flows through your blood, calcium builds your bones, and carbon forms the backbone of every organic molecule in your body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Compounds: When Elements Dance Together</strong></p>
            <p>When elements combine in precise ratios, magic happens. Hydrogen and oxygen—both potentially explosive gases—join forces to create water, the substance of life. Sodium, a metal that explodes in water, partners with chlorine, a deadly gas, to form table salt. Compounds prove that in chemistry, the whole is often dramatically different from its parts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Mixtures: The Blended World Around Us</strong></p>
            <p>Most of what you encounter daily isn't pure elements or compounds—it's mixtures. The air you breathe is a mixture of gases. The soil that grows your food is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, and countless microorganisms. Your blood is a complex mixture carrying nutrients, waste products, and chemical messengers throughout your body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Solutions: The Ultimate Mixers</strong></p>
            <p>Some mixtures are so perfectly blended that they appear uniform—these are solutions. The ocean is a solution of salt in water. The air is a solution of various gases. Even some metals are solutions—bronze is copper dissolved in tin, creating an alloy stronger than either metal alone.</p>
