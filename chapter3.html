        <h3>Reading Matter's Identity Card</h3>

        <p>
            Every substance in the universe carries an invisible ID card written in
            its properties. Just as detectives use fingerprints to identify people,
            chemists use properties to identify matter.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Physical Properties: What You Can See Without Changing Anything</strong></p>
            <p>Imagine you're examining a mysterious substance. Its color catches your eye first—perhaps it's a brilliant blue crystal. You notice it's hard enough to scratch glass, it melts at an incredibly high temperature, and it conducts electricity like a champion. You're looking at the physical properties—characteristics you can observe without changing what the substance actually is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-success">
            <p><strong>Chemical Properties: The Hidden Personality</strong></p>
            <p>But physical properties only tell part of the story. To truly know a substance, you need to see how it behaves—its chemical properties. Does it burst into flames when exposed to air? Does it fizz when you add acid? Does it react violently with water? These chemical properties reveal the substance's true character, but you can only discover them by allowing reactions to happen.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Think of it this way: you can describe someone's appearance (physical
            properties) without changing who they are, but to understand their
            personality (chemical properties), you need to interact with them.
